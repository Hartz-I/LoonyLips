# LoonyLips

## Hello Adventurer!
### Welcome to a journey holding vast riches and gold! (Not in reality but in your imagination!)

This game is just like the party game mad lips. You are asked for some words of various type and then the words are put into a predetermined story so that it becomes funny!

and thats it!

### This is my first GODOT guided project. I'll be practicing more in the future! Hope our paths may cross soon with an original!

# How to Play:
- Download the "LoonyLips.exe" file from the rood folder
- Open it
- Do as the game tells you to do

# Best Wishes!
